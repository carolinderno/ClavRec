#Comparison of claves' recordings

The aim of this analysis is to compare two short musical rhythms played with claves: 
One given rhythm vs one reproduced rhythm.

Thus one can conclude how good a person reproduced a heard rhythm with claves.

Some restrictions are made:
1. Only one set of claves
2. Neglect of volume when comparing rhythms
3. Constant tempo of the given rhythm at 120 bpm
4. Sampling rate of 44.1 kHz
5. Only one four-four time
6. At least 3, at most 9 notes
7. Little random noise
8. Neglect of possible familiarity of the rhythms
9. Limitation of the sample: only students of Catholic University of Eichst√§tt-Ingolstadt

Without some of these restrictions the code might not work.
